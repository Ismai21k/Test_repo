Question 1
Can you share a bit about yourself? Where are you from, and what are you currently doing in your career?

Answer 1:
I’m Ismail Kabir, a passionate entrepreneur who loves business and constantly seeks knowledge through reading. I hail from Kaduna State, Nigeria, and I’m currently running my business—and doing pretty well at it!

Question 2
How did you find out about ALX, and what convinced you that it was the right fit for you?

Answer 2:
I discovered ALX on LinkedIn. Words can’t fully capture what convinced me to join, but let me put it this way: ALX exceeded all my expectations. Before ALX, I struggled with online courses. I would start but never finish because video-based learning often made me lose interest or feel disengaged. I craved a balance between videos and reading materials, but most programs didn’t offer that.

ALX, however, got it right! They provided the perfect mix of resources that kept me engaged, and that’s why I not only completed the course but also hit a major milestone in my life—it was the first online program I’ve ever finished. Big thanks to ALX for this life-changing experience!

Question 3
Can you share how ALX has contributed to your growth? For example, did it help you secure a job, achieve a promotion at work, or elevate your work performance?

Answer 3:
ALX has been a game-changer for me. It helped me realize I’m capable of far more than I ever imagined. My confidence skyrocketed as I started finding innovative solutions to problems, knowing where to look for answers and how to execute them.

Before ALX, I had no clue about the concept of a growth mindset. I used to think a mindset was just a mindset—but now I understand the difference between a fixed and growth mindset. This shift in perspective has not only improved my personal development but also brought significant progress in my business. I can confidently say ALX is a big part of the success I’m seeing today.

Question 4
What skills or knowledge gained from ALX have helped you take the next step in your career?

Answer 4:
The most important skill I gained from ALX is the growth mindset. Since embracing the belief that I can learn almost anything, my life has started to shift. This newfound perspective has brought significant changes in how I approach challenges.

Now, I believe I can achieve anything I set my mind to and learn anything I desire. That belief alone has transformed the way I see myself and my potential. In my opinion, this is one of the most valuable skills anyone can have, as it builds confidence and the drive to keep pushing forward.
